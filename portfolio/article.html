                    <p>In this page, you will see some of my goals during high school, and post high school (going into adulthood). These are just some simple goals, that I'm very sure everyone else shares. While I did put these goals into my site, I'm not exactly saying that I will succeed in all of them.</p>

My parents put a lot of pressure on me to succeed in school, mostly because we have oppurtunities that they didn't. A majority of my extended family lives abroad, so they don't get the things we have, I need to be able to do well in order to make my family proud.</p>

                    <p class = "list-group-item-text">Basketball is my favorite sport of all time. Originally I used to play soccer, but once I started playing this one sport, everything just felt right. One of my most important goals is to make the basketball team, at this point it's become a challenge for me. At most, I am mediocre, but if I play vigorously, I might have a chance.</p>

                    <p class = "list-group-item-text">College is a major goal in my life, I need to be able to get into a school for higher education. My first choice for college is UPenn, it's an ivy league that is not as hard to get into as the others. My other choices are UNC and NYU, mostly because I look both of the cities they're in (Chapel Hill and New York) as well as the athletics program (Tar Heels). My last choice is Rutgers, even though most people put it down, the college is progressing and will be a very good one.</p>

                    <p class = "list-group-item-text">Getting a masters degree is one goal for me, it would make my family so proud. I want to get a degree in accounting (as a back up) and mainly want to get into medicine. While I do seem immature and stupid at a glance, don't worry I am nothing like that with my school work. Hopefully I can successfully do this, and be able to do everything that I want.</p>

<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">Volunteering</h4>


<p class = "list-group-item-text">I was a part of the club Viking Volunteers for my 10th grade year, I did a couple of things there. Mostly I volunteer at the Sunday School in my Gurdwara (like a church). There I help out the teachers with things like, keeping the room clean, helping to make new additions to the program, and I also partake in a class there. It helps me learn about my religion</p>

<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">


<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">Jobs</h4>


<p class = "list-group-item-text">Last year I wasn't able to get a job, (my parents didn't allow it). But now, since I will be able to get my license soon, they will allow it. I plan to apply to work at Target or Best Buy, maybe even a store at a mall, such as Footlocker, or maybe even a different clothing store.</p>


</a>


<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">


<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">Successes</h4>


<p class = "list-group-item-text">I actually managed to train my dog by myself. I used methods given by one training course, as well as some videos on youtube. I taught him simple things, like sit, down, and even stay. As well as things like how to ask for food, as well as even how to stay away from things he can't have. As of right now I am working on loose leash training so that he can stay near me off of leash, as well as listen in general.</p>

<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">


<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">Get a masters degree</h4>


<p class = "list-group-item-text">Getting a masters degree is one goal for me, it would make my family so proud. I want to get a degree in accounting (as a back up) and mainly want to get into medicine. While I do seem immature and stupid at a glance, don't worry I am nothing like that with my school work. Hopefully I can successfully do this, and be able to do everything that I want.</p>
